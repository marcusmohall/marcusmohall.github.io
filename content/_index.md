I am a lecturer in the [Division of Technology and Social Change](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/tema/temat) at the [Department of Thematic Studies](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/tema) at Link√∂ping University. Trained as a human geographer (PhD, Uppsala University, 2021), my research interests primarily revolve around the political economy of (public) transportation, housing, and urban planning and policy more broadly.
